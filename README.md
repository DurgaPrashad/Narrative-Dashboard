# Narrative Dashboard - AI-Powered Business Intelligence

Transform your business data into actionable insights with AI-powered natural language analysis.


## 🎯 What is Narrative Dashboard?

Narrative Dashboard is a professional business intelligence platform that connects to your existing business tools (Shopify, Salesforce, QuickBooks, etc.) and uses Google's Gemini AI to provide instant insights through natural language conversations.

**Instead of spending hours analyzing charts and reports, simply ask:**
- "How much revenue did I make this month?"
- "Which products are my best sellers?"
- "Compare this quarter's performance to last quarter"
- "Show me customer acquisition trends"

4. Response includes real numbers from user's business:

> "Your November 2024 sales reached ₹8.7L from Shopify and ₹2.1L from direct Stripe payments, totaling ₹10.8L - a 15.3% increase from October's ₹9.4L. Your top product 'Wireless Headphones' generated ₹2.3L (21% of total sales). Mumbai region contributed 34% of sales. Weekend sales averaged 28% higher than weekdays.
